# The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Platform is a web-based application.

The Coindash Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Platform is a web-based application that allows you to earn <your_company > tokens (<your_tokens>) at the point of initial allocation. <your_tokens> are earned by making contributions in either BTC, COINDASH or STRAT. Changelly is also integrated into the ICO Platform, and you can use this service to convert other cryptocurrencies into COINDASH or STRAT before contributing.
<your_company> uses Onfido for identify verification. This guide provides step by step instructions on how to complete this process, so you can begin making contributions.
For your own security, you can also set up 2-Factor Authentication, and this guide shows you how to do this. Once the <your_ICO> is complete, you can withdraw the <your_tokens> that you earned through your contributions. This guide includes a chapter on how to do this.
